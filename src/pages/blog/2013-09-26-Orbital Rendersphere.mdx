The Orbital Rendersphere is an enormous spherical persistence of vision display I built with a team from the [Hoboken Makerbar](http://makerbar.com/). Debuted at World Maker Faire in NYC in 2013, it became an instant crowd favorite and was honored with 4 Editor’s Choice ribbons and 1 Educator’s Choice ribbon, and was subsequently featured as a project spotlight on [BeagleBoard.org](http://beagleboard.org/blog/2013-12-17-project-spotlight-orbital-rendersphere/)
