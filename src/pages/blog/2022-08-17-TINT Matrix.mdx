This is a wifi-enabled LED matrix display that I made as a teambuilding project for my team at work. You can connect to it over wifi and send it text, which will scroll across the display.

It was designed around an inexpensive microcontroller dev board and LED matrix display that could easily be purchased online and delivered to members of our fully remote team. Everything can be assembled without any tools or soldering.

Instructions, code, and model files for the 3d printed enclosure are available on the project page here: https://github.com/esp1/tint-matrix.
